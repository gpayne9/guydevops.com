## Hey, I'm Guy.

I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer at LendingTree. I spend most of my time building and maintaining cloud infrastructure across AWS and Azure — multi-account setups, container platforms, CI/CD pipelines, and a lot of Terraform.

This site is where I write about things I've built or problems I've worked through. Everything here includes real code that I've actually deployed somewhere.

### What I Work With

Day to day, I'm mostly in AWS — managing Organizations with multiple production accounts, ECS clusters, CloudFront distributions, Lambda, WAF, IAM policies, and VPC networking. On the Azure side, I work with ADO pipelines, AKS, and App Services.

I write a lot of Terraform, some Python, some Bash, and occasionally .NET. Most of my CI/CD work is in GitLab — building and maintaining pipelines across multiple teams and environments. If it can be automated, I'd rather not do it by hand.

Beyond work, I run a [homelab](/posts/homelab-pi-tailscale-ollama-pihole/) with a Raspberry Pi, Mac mini, and Tailscale — mostly for local AI inference with Ollama and network-wide ad blocking with Pi-hole.

Lately I've been deep into running AI locally and exploring agentic workflows — using tools like Claude Code and Ollama to build and vibe-code applications with AI as a collaborator rather than just a chatbot. I'm especially interested in finding ways AI can make DevOps teams significantly more productive, whether that's automating toil, building smarter CI/CD pipelines, or creating internal tools that would've taken weeks to build manually.
